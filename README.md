# Project Title

This project generates a fancy QR code with custom styling.

## Missing File Notice

### `logo.png`

The `logo.png` file is missing from this repository. This file is essential for the QR code generation process if you want to include a logo at the center of the QR code.

### How to Add `logo.png`

1. **Create or obtain a logo**: Ensure your logo file is named `logo.png`.
2. **Place it in the project directory**: Make sure the file is in the root directory of the project to be recognized by the script.

### Impact of Missing `logo.png`

If `logo.png` is not available, the QR code will be generated without a logo, and the script will continue to function with a notification indicating the absence of the logo.

## Running the Project

To run the QR code generation script, ensure all dependencies are installed and follow the instructions provided in the code comments.

## Setting Up the Project

### Virtual Environment

The `.venv` folder is used to manage the project's dependencies. It is ignored in this repository to avoid uploading local environment files. To set up your own virtual environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

## Install dependencies
